# Gloomhaven Soundboard Deck

The following assumes non-spoiler knowledge of the tabletop version of Gloomhaven, which this was written to be used in conjunction with.

Originally created because there's a really good strategy that Three Spears can use. Debatably legal, but it being really fun and really funny overtook our desire to truly verify. Unfortunately, executing it also takes like, fifteen minutes. So I automated it. I also took some creative liberties and included a terrible obnoxious sound effect for each card. At this point, my Three Spears is retired, but the terrible obnoxious sound effects are still fun, so I still use it.

Currently very much in a state of being worked on by me for me. I hope to someday bring it to a point where things are editable in-app and the visuals aren't so... developer.
